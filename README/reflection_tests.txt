My reflection on the AI generated Tests

I used the chat based approach, the files and dependencies were all generated.

At the beginning, only a few passed, but some of the tests needed a mock before working

After inspecting, and a few tweaks, i got the tests working

What didn't work were some complex operations which needs a complex mockinn which was eventually removed because it didn't affect the application

What suprised me was how quickly the AI was able to generate the mock from the mocks, and how easy i was able to test the applicaton at the current state
